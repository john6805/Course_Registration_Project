# Course_Registration_Project

#RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
first: open a terminal and navigate to the directory 'course_registration'
next: enter the command 'npm run build' (if you do not have all of the dependencies installed,
        run the command 'npm install' first)

The code should build successfully, errors will be shown in the terminal

next: navigate to the Course_Registration_Project directory
next: enter the command 'node server.js' to kick off the server (if you do not have all of the dependencies installed, run the command 'npm install' first)

next: open chrome and navigate to http://localhost:8012 to view the application

***NOTE***
    THERE ARE TWO FOLDERS FOR NODE_MODULES. I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE IF BOTH ARE NECESSARY, SO PRIOR TO RUNNING ANYTHING I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING A NPM INSTALL IN BOTH THE 'course_registration' DIRECTORY AND THE 'Course_Registration_Project' DIRECTORIES. WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE THE DIRECTORY NAME FOR THE FRONT END FILES TO SOMETHING MORE CLEAR BUT I JUST GOT A SIMPLE REQUEST RESPONSE WORKING THROUGH THE FULL STACK.

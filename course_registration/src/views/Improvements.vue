    <h1>Improvements over Murphy</h1>
  
    <p><b>Client side processing:</b> Server sends JSON objects to the client instead of HTML and JavaScript. Vue.js framework allows for a faster, more seamless experience.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Real-time updates:</b> Using a websocket node package, students and faculty are able to see real-time updates to class availability and waitlist changes.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Don't change what works:</b> Functionality from the old system that works well, such as searching for classes and CRNs, was integrated into our new system.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Clearer and easier to understand registration process:</b> Class list highlights, with colors, what classes you're signed up for an on the waitlist for. An integrated schedule shows you your current list of classes and their times. Add and drop classes from the list or the schedule on demand.</p>

    <p><b>Everything you need on one page:</b> Instead of going from one part of the site to another to find CRNs, courses, etc. do everything from one page, adding to the ease of use.</p>

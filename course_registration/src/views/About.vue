      I am 22 years old born in Atlanta Georgia. I am currently a Senior at UST, and am double majoring in Computer Science and Finance. I currently work for Dispute Resolution Data, a company that aggregates and displays data regarding international arbitration and mediation cases. In my freetime, I am the President of the UST Rowing club and enjoy all the perks included. In the future I hope to work in New York for a few years in the Financial Technology sector.

      My name is Jacob Johnson. I am a senior computer science major at UST.
      I am a captain on the Men's Basketball team at St. Thomas. I really enjoy music,
      especially live music. I love going to concerts or seeing local bands. I am a huge
      Minnesota sports fan. Like all Minnesota sports fans, I hate waking up every Sunday
      and being dissapointed in the Vikings. Every day is torment having to deal with these
      extremely mediocre franchises who constantly let everyone down. Maybe one day we will
      see a championship parade down first avenue. But probably not.

      I am a senior here at UST majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Statistics. Last summer I interned for Northrop Grumman as a network engineering intern. I'm not sure what I'd like to do for a career yet but I'm open to just about anything in the field. I'm the founder and president of the St. Thomas eSports club and compete at a collegiate level against other schools across Minnesota. Other hobbies I enjoy are biking, collecting vinyl, and building electronics.
